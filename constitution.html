                          <li>Any decision involving a member of the GSA must be voted upon by secret ballot.</li>
                          <li>The Facilitator, for all decisions not involving a member of the GSA, and unless stated otherwise in this constitution, may select one of the following voting procedures:
                            <ol type="I">
                              <li>Unanimous Consent: the facilitator will ask the GSA if a vote in favor of a decision (i.e. Unanimous Consent) may be made via Unanimous Consent. 
                                If one (1) or more members objects to Unanimous Consent, voting will be conducted by secret ballot. 
                              </li>
                              <li>Anonymous Voting: the Facilitator will ask the GSA to close their eyes, and then raise their hands  in favor of the decision. 
                                The facilitator will ask again for the GSA to close their eyes, and then raise their hands in opposition to the vote. 
                                The result of the vote will be determined based on the number of votes in favor of the 
                                decision to the number of votes in opposition of the vote. In the event of a tie, voting will be conducted by secret  ballot.
                              </li>
                              <li>Secret Ballot: the Facilitator will distribute blank  paper to the GSA membership. The GSA membership will write down their vote on the paper and return the vote to the Facilitator. 
                                The Facilitator will count the votes and announce the result of the vote to the GSA membership.
