	<p>Below are graduate students who are interested in being an individual and/or small group mentor for the Spring 2021 semester. Undergraduates will be given an option to specifiy a preferred mentor upon signing up. If a mentor is not specified, the AMP committee will use information gathered during sign up to determine a suitable mentor for the semester.</p><br/>

		I am a second year MS student interested in synoptic (large) scale meteorology and forecasting. I work with Jon Martin to partition vertical motions in the troposphere. When it’s time to get a big girl job, I’d like to work for the National Weather Service, as an educator, or in risk management. I would love to mentor students in small groups as well as those who identify as LGBTQ+. Outside of the AOS building I enjoy cheering on my favorite sports teams, running, competing in triathlons, playing card games, and spending time with my people.

		I’m currently in my third year at UW, as a member of Ankur Desai’s lab. My research centers around the use of ecosystem models to understand impacts of management regimes on carbon and water cycling in forests. Post grad school I’d like to work as a research scientist at a government lab. When not absorbed by classes and research, I enjoy kayaking, camping, yoga, live music, craftin’…if I get to be outside or be creating, I’m in.

		I am a second year master's student studying large scale dynamics and synoptic scale features using numerical weather modeling. After graduating, I would either like to work in a research setting, for the National Weather Service, or with in the private sector. I am open to having a mentee with any background or interests. In my free time, I enjoy running, eating good food, napping, and playing soccer or tennis.

		<p class="bio"><big><strong>Zoë</strong></big><br/>
I’m a fourth year graduate student working with Professor Michael Morgan on numerical weather prediction models, focusing on tropical cyclone predictability. My career goal is to become a professor. Receiving my undergraduate degree from the AOS Department as well, I am able to speak to the experience of navigating college as a woman in STEM and being from a low income background. Outside of school, I love dancing, live music, ultimate frisbee, playing with my dog, and basically anything outdoors.

		<p class="bio"><big><strong>Alicia</strong></big><br/>
I am a second year graduate student working with Tracey Holloway to model the interactions of chemistry and meteorology. These interactions can be important drivers of air quality, so I am especially interested in pollutants like ozone. After (hopefully) graduating, I would like to teach at a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) so that I can focus more of my time of teaching and less on research. In my spare time, I like to knit and crochet, bake unhealthy desserts, and go hiking to work off the unhealthy desserts.

	<img class="bio" src="pics/Jerrold.jpg" alt="Jerrold"/>
		<p class="bio"><big><strong>Jerrold</strong></big><br/>
I’m a second year graduate student working with SSEC Director Brad Pierce. My research is focused on analyzing remotely sensed atmospheric chemistry data and modeling air pollution transport. After graduation, I hope to work for a governmental agency (e.g., NASA) or at an educational institution as a faculty member. In my free time I enjoy playing racquet sports, going to EDM concerts, and keeping up with national politics.

		<p class="bio"><big><strong>Juliet</strong></big><br/>
I am a fourth year PhD student studying convection's influence on Earth's
energy budget and water cycle. I would like to continue down the
research scientist path while also engaging the public in discussing
science and climate-related issues. Perhaps a long way down the road I
would like to be a professor, as I really enjoy working with students. I
would love to mentor students of any ethnic and economic backgrounds no
matter what stage you are in your undergraduate career. Having a
work-life balance is crucial, so I really love to sing and play
instruments, especially with friends, and to be active and outdoors as
much as possible.

I am a second year Master's student working with Professor Jonathan Martin on synoptic-scale dynamics in the southern hemisphere as they relate to observed rapid surface warming events on the Antarctic continent in austral winter. I currently work at the Antarctic Meteorological Research Center as an instrument technician. I hope to learn more about the behavior of the atmosphere and relate that to my work in Antarctic meteorology and climatology. I like to bike, play sports, play guitar, and eat Greenbush donuts.</p>

		<p class="bio"><big><strong>Nuo</strong></big><br/>
I am a second year graduate student interested in tropical cyclone dynamics, and wish to improve the predictability by combining numerical simulation and observations. I have previous internship experience at my hometown meteorology bureau in China. While my future hugely depends on various policies, I would like to go into the forecasting business before going back to scientific research track. I like working out at gym, listening to musicals, learning languages to understand the musicals I listen to, watching TV shows and Bon Appétit.</p>

<img class="bio" src="pics/Sreenath.jpg" alt="Sreenath"/>
                <p class="bio"><big><strong>Sreenath</strong></big><br/>
I am a third year PhD student in Ankur Desai's ecometeorology lab. In my current research I work with high resolution observations and models of the atmospheric boundary layer to understand surface atmosphere exchanges over heterogeneous land surfaces. The dream is to continue in academia and become a professor. Outside of research and school, I love to bike , wander around cities and find quiet spots to read or watch films.

I am a second year student working in the Large Scale Dynamics and Ciruculation Group under the advisement of Ángel F. Adames-Corraliza. My research is focused on the dyanmic and theromodyamic processes involved during MJO initiation events. Overall my interests are pretty broad but I enjoy subseasonal to seasonal forecasting and topics in general circulation. Outside of school I enjoy baking and cookie decorating!
